The signtool is an utility that can be used to issue sign/verify requests for a development or
production mode.

The development mode uses keys generated from an OpenSSL environment, while a production mode
uses the IBM Crypto Card to generate and sign builds.

A more detailed info about the signtool is in AutomatedSigning.odt file under the docs directory, a
more complete example of signtool usage is in SignImage under the scripts directory.
